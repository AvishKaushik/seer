seergdb (2.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Fixed infinite loop when starting with RR mode.
  * Reworked RR mode to directly run 'rr replay'.
    No need to start a 'rr server' and connect to it.

  * Fixed Source handling in source browser. Qt5 mode was broken.
    Qt6 works.  Directory paths need a tailing "/*"
