 https://support.flaticon.com/s/article/Attribution-How-when-and-where?language=en_US

 This is a human-readable summary of (and not a substitute for) the license.

 If you are a Free user you must always attribute the author when using our resources,
 below you can see the structure of the correct attribution line.

 The attribution line would follow the same rules:

   "Icon made by Freepik from www.flaticon.com"

 You need to include one line for each author (not for each icon).

 Please note that there are 18 packs created by third parties and therefore not covered by
 our license:
    All packs created by Google: https://www.flaticon.com/authors/google
    And this pack: https://www.flaticon.com/autores/dave-gandy


 Below you can find a few different scenarios and how the attribution must be inserted for
 each of them:

 Websites:

    Insert the attribution on the page where the icon is shown. This can be placed next to
    the image or on the footer of the website.

 Printed products:

    Paste this attribution on the final work so the authorship is known (for instance, in the
    acknowledgements chapter of a book).

 Apps/games:

    Place the attribution on the app's credits page and on the description page on the app store.

 Social Networks:

    Insert the attribution line "Icon made by [author link] from @flaticon" (E.g.: Icon made by
    Freepik from @flaticon) on the post or post comments.

 Stickers:

  It would be great if you could add the attribution line "Sticker made by Flaticon" where you use it,
  but we understand that it's complicated to add this line in a chat, and therefore it's not mandatory
  to add the attribution line if you use our stickers in a chat.
