Notes for debugging hellogdbserver with Seer.

In one terminal, start gdbserver.

    $ gdbserver :1234 hellogdbserver

In another terminal, start Seer with the project file.

    $ /usr/local/bin/seergdb -xxx -s --project project.seer


When exiting Seer, make sure to enter this command into the
gdb command field. Otherwise, the gdbserver process will hang
and you will need to 'kill -9' the gdbserver process.

    (gdb) monitor exit
